			The Abu Simbel temples are two massive rock-cut temples at Abu Simbel village in Aswan Governorate, Upper Egypt, near the border with Sudan. They are situated on the western bank of Lake Nasser, about 230 km (140 mi) southwest of Aswan (about 300 km (190 mi) by road).The complex was relocated in its entirety in 1968 under the supervision of a Polish archaeologist, Kazimierz Michałowski, from the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw,on an artificial hill made from a domed structure, high above the Aswan High Dam reservoir. The relocation of the temples was necessary or they would have been submerged during the creation of Lake Nasser, the massive artificial water reservoir formed after the building of the Aswan High Dam on the River Nile. The project was carried out as part of the UNESCO Nubian Salvage Campaign.
			During his reign, Ramesses II embarked on an extensive building program throughout Egypt and Nubia, which Egypt controlled. Nubia was very important to the Egyptians because it was a source of gold and many other precious trade goods. He, therefore, built several grand temples there in order to impress upon the Nubians Egypt's might and Egyptianize the people of Nubia.

			Built in 1244 B.C., Abu Simbel contains two temples, carved into a mountainside. The larger of the two temples contains four colossal statues of a seated pharaoh Ramesses II (1303-1213 B.C.) at its entrance, each about 69 feet (21 meters) tall. The entranceway to the temple was built in such a way that on two days of the year, October 22 and February 22, sunlight shines into the inner sanctuary and lights up three statues seated on a bench, including one of the pharaoh. Historians think these dates mark his coronation and birth. Thousands of tourists typically flock to the temples to watch the phenomenon and participate in the celebrations.

		Who Built it
</H1>
<P>
	<B>
			This site of two temples built by the Egyptian king Ramses II (reigned 1279–13 BCE), now located in Aswān muḥāfaẓah (governorate), southern Egypt. In ancient times the area was at the southern frontier of pharaonic Egypt, facing Nubia. The four colossal statues of Ramses in front of the main temple are spectacular examples of ancient Egyptian art. By means of a complex engineering feat in the 1960s, the temples were salvaged from the rising waters of the Nile River caused by erection of the Aswan High Dam.

			  Hawass notes that moving the temples was a massive job, one that involved cutting it into pieces between 3 to 20 tons in weight and re-assembling them precisely as they were. It took almost five years, involved about 3,000 workers and cost (in the 1960s) about $42 million.
<br><br>
			(1) Ramesses II
			Ramesses II, sometimes called “the great,” was a warrior king who tried to expand Egypt’s territory far into the Levant. He battled another empire called the Hittites at the Battle of Qadesh (also spelled Kadesh) in Syria and also launched campaigns into Nubia.
<br>
			(2)The Great Temple
			Egyptologist Marco Zecchi writes in his book "Abu Simbel, Aswan and the Nubian Temples" (White Star Publishers, 2004) that the larger of the two Abu Simbel temples, the Great Temple, was known in ancient times as “the temple of Ramesses-Meryamun” which means “Ramesses, beloved by Amun” (Amun being an important deity in Ramesses II’s time). Zecchi notes that the four seated statues of the pharaoh, at the entrance, show the ruler wearing a short kilt, nemes headdress, double crown with cobra and false beard.
<br>
			(3)The Small Temple
			As mentioned earlier, the smaller temple at Abu Simbel has, outside its entrance, four statues of pharaoh and two of his bride, Nefertari. Each statue is about 33 feet (10 meters) tall, a buttress in between each of them. Zecchi notes that the facade also contains smaller statues of the children, “oddly the statues of the princesses are taller than those of the princes,” a sign, perhaps, that this temple pays tribute to Nefertari and the women of Ramesses II’s household.

			Established as part of the UNESCO International Campaign for the Establishment of the Nubia Museum in Aswan and the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo, the Nubia Museum in Aswan opened to the public in November 1997 and has won widespread praise for the quality of its design and collections.
			The Nubia Museum in Aswan houses finds made during excavations carried out as part of UNESCO’s International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia, threatened by the construction of the Aswan High Dam in the 1960s. Besides showcasing many of the more than 3,000 objects found during the excavations, the Museum serves as a focal point for Nubian history and culture, its collections presenting the history of Nubia from prehistory to the present day.
			Designed by the Egyptian architect Mahmoud El-Hakim, with landscaping by Werkmeister & Heimer Landscape Architects (Germany) and Leila Masri of Sites International, the Museum’s exhibitions were designed by Mexican architect Pedro Ramerez Varquez. The Nubia Museum occupies a 50,000 square-metre site on the banks of the Nile at Aswan, 7,000 square metres of which are given over to the Museum building. Designed to evoke traditional Nubian village architecture and finished in local sandstone and pink granite, the Museum was one of the winners of the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2001. 
			The little-visited Nubia Museum, opposite Basma Hotel, is a treat, a showcase of the history, art and culture of Nubia. Established in 1997 in cooperation with Unesco, the museum is a reminder of what was lost beneath Lake Nasser. Exhibits are beautifully displayed in huge halls, where clearly written explanations take you from 4500 BC through to the present day.
			The exhibits start with prehistoric artefacts and objects from the Kingdom of Kush and Meroe. Coptic and Islamic art displays lead to a description of the massive Unesco project to move Nubia’s most important historic monuments away from the rising waters of Lake Nasser, following the building of the Aswan High Dam.
			One of the results of international efforts made during the UNESCO International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia from the rising waters of Lake Nasser behind the Aswan High Dam, the Nubia Museum showcases one of Egypt’s many civilizations. It also functions as a community museum for the Nubian people, having an important education programme and raising local, national and international awareness of Nubian history and culture.
			In 2011, the Nubia Museum hosted an exhibition entitled ‘Common History: A Museological and Educational Approach to the Dialogue of Cultures and Civilizations.’
			The Nubia Museum in Aswan hosts a research and documentation centre on Nubian archaeology, history and culture, as well as materials relating to the UNESCO International Campaign. It is surrounded by landscaped grounds that integrate it into the local topography and serve as an outdoor exhibition area on the Nubian environment.

		The Building

	<B>
		The Nubian Museum (officially the International Museum of Nubia) is an archaeological museum located in Aswan, Upper Egypt. It was built to a design by architect Mahmoud El-Hakim for an estimated construction cost of LE 75 million (approximately $22 million at the time). Dedicated to Nubian culture and civilization, it was inaugurated on November 23, 1997, and was awarded the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2001.
		The Nubian Museum covers an area of 50,000 square meters, 7,000 of which are devoted to the building, while the rest are devoted to gardens and other public spaces.[1] The building has three floors for displaying and housing, in addition to a library and information center. The largest part of the museum is occupied by the monumental pieces, reflecting phases of the development of Nubian culture and civilization. The Museum is built on a steep cliff, which enables it to embody a full scale design for the Nile river from its origins in Ethiopia and Sudan to Egypt. The edifice is surrounded by a Natural Botanical Garden, which contains a large variety of Egyptian flora.

		Opened in 1997, the Nubian Museum is a belated, but well-executed, tribute to the culture and influence of Nubia and the Nubian people on the history of Egypt. This ancient culture, every bit as old as that of Ancient Egypt, existed along the banks of the Nile for millennia in the areas we call southern Egypt and northern Sudan today.
		It was nearly destroyed by the construction of the High Dam, completely submerging the ancient heartland of Nubia, and over 100,000 people to relocate. The museum houses a collection of artifacts from the Nubia region, which tell the story of the development of civilization in the southern Nile Valley from prehistory all the way through the pharaonic ages, the arrival of Christianity and Islam, and the construction of the dam in the 1960’s.
		The plight of the Nubia people is a highly politicized issue. In the rush to develop the country in the 1950’s and 60’s, the Egyptian government did not provide adequate compensation or a sufficient planning to resettle the people whose livelihoods were affected by projects like the High Dam.
		The preservation of Nubia’s cultural legacy was equally neglected. International organizations came in to move some of the most famous monuments of Nubia to high ground, like the Abu Simbel temples. Others were dismantled and shipped abroad as compensation for aiding this effort. The Dendar Temple that now stands in the New York Metropolitan Museum is one such gifted Nubian monument.
		The Nubian Museum was intended to help rectify this injustice. While that may not be possible, especially since it still makes no mention of the consequences of the dam for the Nubian people, it is very effective at telling the story of the region and providing a glimpse of the culture that continues to exist here. Reconstructions of traditional Nubian houses with artwork salvaged from areas that are now underwater are particularly striking.
		The museum is near the Fatamid Cemetery, which is full of small mausoleums dating from the 9th century. Some of the tombs here belong to local saints and they are decorated accordingly with flags and often visited by local people seeking blessings. The cemetery stands next to the ancient granite quarry where the Unfinished Obelisk is located. At nearly 140 feet long,
		it would have been the largest obelisk ever carved by the ancient Egyptians. It was completely finished on three sides, but left attached to the bedrock when a flaw in the stone was discovered.

		History of the obelisk
</H1>

<P>
	<B>
			The Unfinished Obelisk is a huge Granite block in Aswan city, it could be traced back to the ruling era of the New Kingdom, and it remains unfinished in its original position in the Southern Aswan Granite quarry.
			According to scientists, this enormous granite piece would have been the largest solid piece humans ever worked on, if it was completed. Weighing over 18 million kilogram, and its height is measuring up to about 134 meters if completely erected. It would have been the largest obelisk Pharaohs ever constructed. However, the obelisk was abandoned in its original location due to a defect discovered around the base during the construction process.
			Tourists are usually taken to see the ‘unfinished obelisk’ that remains its position fixed to a side of the rock. A giant single piece of granite, located in the northern section of the quarries, was supposed to be an obelisk accredited to Queen Hatshepsut since it is quite similar to her obelisk at Temple of Karnak in Luxor. One could find exquisite sculptural reliefs in Deir el-Bahri temple of Hatshepsut, portraying the procedures of moving an obelisk from a place another.
			The precious stones used in the building of Egypt’s monuments are gotten from ancient granite quarries located in the southern part of Aswan town.

			Its creation was ordered by Hatshepsut (1508–1458 BC), possibly to complement what would later be known as the Lateran Obelisk (which was originally at Karnak, and was later brought to the Lateran Palace in Rome). The unfinished obelisk is nearly one-third larger than any ancient Egyptian obelisk ever erected. If finished it would have measured around 42 metres (138 ft) and would have weighed nearly 1,090 tonnes (1,200 short tons), a weight equal to about 200 African elephants.[1]
			The obelisk's creators began to carve it directly out of bedrock, but cracks appeared in the granite and the project was abandoned. The bottom side of the obelisk is still attached to the bedrock.
			The unfinished obelisk offers unusual insights into ancient Egyptian stone-working techniques, with marks from workers' tools still clearly visible as well as ochre-colored lines marking where they were working.
			Besides the unfinished obelisk, an unfinished, partly worked obelisk base was discovered in 2005 at the quarries of Aswan.[2] Also discovered were some rock carvings and remains that may correspond to the site where most of the famous obelisks were worked. All these quarries in Aswan and the unfinished objects are an open-air museum and are officially protected by the Egyptian government as an archeological site.

		The Construction
</H1>

<P>
	<B>
			An obelisk is traditionally defined as a tall and slender monument, with four sides converging to a mini pyramidal shape at the top. Though it's technically a Greek type of architecture, there are few obelisks in Egypt, and the unfinished obelisk of Aswan is known to be one of the largest among them. It was constructed by Hatshepsut, the queen of Thutmose II, who also ruled Egypt as a Pharaoh from 1478 to 1458 B.C., jointly with Thutmose III, who was then only a child. This obelisk was perhaps built following the example of the Lateran Obelisk that was initially built at Karnak Temple Complex in Egypt and was later shifted to the Lateran square of Rome, near the end of the Roman Empire. This obelisk provides much information about the stone-carving procedures of ancient Egyptians, as the scratches of their instruments can still be clearly seen on the rock surface. Also, some ochre-colored lines were probably drawn to mark the places where the workers were supposed to carve out the granite. Now it is known that the ancient Egyptians utilized small balls of a mineral, harder than granite, known as dolerite, as ball-bearings to cut through the rocks. They used a special technique to separate the granite from the bedrock, where they made very small cavities in the body of the rock, all along the line of desired detachment. Those cavities were then filled with wood chips and the chips were soaked thoroughly with water. This soaking made the wood expand in volume, causing the rock to crack along the drawn lines and finally get detached from its base. But until recently, nothing could be found out about their other technological instruments, which were used in architecture or sculpting out hard granite.
