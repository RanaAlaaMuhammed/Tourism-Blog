			Covering a 7km stretch of the Western Desert, Saqqara, the huge cemetery of ancient Memphis, was an active burial ground for more than 3500 years and is Egypt’s largest archaeological site. The necropolis is situated high above the Nile Valley’s cultivation area, and is the final resting place for deceased pharaohs and their families, administrators, generals and sacred animals. The name Saqqara is most likely derived from Sokar, the Memphite god of the dead.
			Old Kingdom pharaohs were buried within Saqqara’s 11 major pyramids, while their subjects were buried in the hundreds of smaller tombs. Most of Saqqara, except for the Step Pyramid, was buried in sand until the mid-19th century, when the great French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette uncovered the Serapeum. Since then, it has been a gradual process of rediscovery: the Step Pyramid’s massive funerary complex was not exposed until 1924, and it is in a constant state of restoration. French architect Jean-Philippe Lauer, who began work here in 1926, was involved in the project for an incredible 75 years until his death in 2001. More recently, there has been a string of new discoveries, including a whole slew of mummies and even a new pyramid.
			If you keep up a good pace, you can see the high points of Saqqara in about half a day. Start with a quick visit to the Imhotep Museum, to get the lay of the land. Head for Zoser’s funerary complex, entering through the hypostyle hall, and gaze on the Step Pyramid, the world’s oldest pyramid. Walk south towards the Causeway of Unas then drive to the Pyramid of Teti to see some of the famous Pyramid Texts inside. Afterwards, pop into the nearby Tomb of Kagemni before ending with the most wonderful tomb of all, the Mastaba of Ti, with its fascinating reliefs of daily life

			The 6-tier, 4-sided structure is the earliest colossal stone building in Egypt. It was built in the 27th century BC during the Third Dynasty for the burial of Pharaoh Djoser. The pyramid is the central feature of a vast mortuary complex in an enormous courtyard surrounded by ceremonial structures and decoration.
			The pyramid went through several revisions and redevelopments of the original plan. The pyramid originally stood 62.5 metres (205 ft) tall, with a base of 109 m × 121 m (358 ft × 397 ft) and was clad in polished white limestone. The step pyramid (or proto-pyramid) is considered to be the earliest large-scale cut stone construction made by man, although the nearby enclosure wall "Gisr el-Mudir" is suggested by some Egyptologists to predate the complex, and the South American pyramids at Caral are contemporary.

			 As with many of the monuments of Egypt, visitors and thieves explored the pyramid complex for centuries after it was abandoned but no systematic exploration was undertaken until Napoleon's Egypt campaign 1798-1801 CE. Napoleon brought a team of scholars and scientists along with his army who explored, examined, recorded, and studied the monuments of ancient Egyptian culture and who, among other accomplishments, discovered the Rosetta Stone in 1799 CE, the trilingual inscription stele which enabled French scholar Jean-Francois Champollion (1790-1832 CE) to decipher the Egyptian hieroglyphs and open up the history of ancient Egypt for the world. Napoleon's expedition was the first systematic study of the civilization and, later, led to the first western museum to install a permanent Egyptian wing at the Louvre in Paris.
			 Following Napoleon's artists and scientists, German, English, and Prussian archaeologists and researchers visited the Step Pyramid throughout the 19th century but no critical, scientific, examination was begun until the 1920's CE when the English archaeologist Cecil Mallaby Firth (1878-1931 CE) arrived at the site. It was Firth who, in 1924 CE, discovered the Serdab and Djoser's statue. In 1926 CE, Firth was joined on site by the French architect and Egyptologist Jean-Philippe Lauer (1902-2001 CE) who would make the major discoveries at the complex and contribute the most to modern-day understanding of pyramid construction generally and the Step Pyramid specifically.

		Giza Plateau

			The pyramids of Giza, Arabic Ahrāmāt Al-Jīzah, Giza also spelled Gizeh,and the Great Sphinx are among the most popular touristic destinations in the world, and indeed already were even in Roman times. Each of these spectacular structures served as the final resting place of a king of the 4th Dynasty (c.2613–2494 BC). The Great Pyramid of Giza was built for king Khufu (c.2589–2566 BC), and the other two for Khafre and Menkaure, his son and grandson. Khufu’s pyramid is both the oldest and largest of the three, and the first building to exceed it in height would not be built for another 3,800 years!
        	Although the three pyramids dominate the plateau, they are in fact surrounded by many other monuments. Every king’s pyramid was just one element—albeit the most important—of a larger complex that included smaller, subsidiary, queens’ pyramids; an additional one that acted as a second, symbolic, tomb for the king, called a satellite pyramid; mastaba tombs for nobility and other family members; burials of actual and/or symbolic boats; and a pair of temples linked by a richly decorated causeway. One of these temples, called the valley temple, led into the pyramid complex, and was located on or near a body of water where boats could dock.

			The three 4th-dynasty (c. 2575–c. 2465 BCE) pyramids erected on a rocky plateau on the west bank of the Nile River near Al-Jīzah (Giza) in northern Egypt. The ancient ruins of the Memphis area, including the Pyramids of Giza, Ṣaqqārah, Dahshūr, Abū Ruwaysh, and Abū Ṣīr, were collectively designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979.
			The Giza Pyramids, built to endure an eternity, have done just that. The monumental tombs are relics of Egypt's Old Kingdom era and were constructed some 4,500 years ago.

			 It was the Egyptians who built the pyramids. The Great Pyramid is dated with all the evidence, I'm telling you now to 4,600 years, the reign of Khufu. The Great Pyramid of Khufu is one of 104 pyramids in Egypt with superstructure. And there are 54 pyramids with substructure. There is support (that) the builders of the pyramids were Egyptians. They are not the Jews as has been said, they are not people from a lost civilization. They are not out of space. They are Egyptian and their skeletons are here, and were examined by scholars, doctors and the race of all the people we found are completely supporting that they are Egyptians.

			 Physicists have used the by-products of cosmic rays to reveal a large, previously unidentified chamber inside the 4,500-year-old Great Pyramid in Giza, Egypt. The find is the first discovery since the nineteenth century of a major new space inside the pyramid.
			Mummy DNA unravels ancient Egyptians’ ancestry
			Egyptologists have been quick to dismiss any idea of finding lost treasure in the 30-metre-long void. “There’s zero chance of hidden burial chambers,” says Aidan Dodson, an Egyptologist at the University of Bristol, UK, who studies ancient Egyptian tombs. But experts hope that the finding will lead to significant insights into how this spectacular pyramid was built.
			The Great Pyramid was constructed by the pharaoh Khufu (also known as Cheops), who reigned from 2509–2483 bc. Constructed from limestone and granite blocks, and rising to 139 metres, it is the oldest and largest of the Giza pyramids and one of the most impressive structures to survive from the ancient world. To see through the Great Pyramid, the researchers used a technique developed in high-energy particle physics: they tracked particles called muons, which are produced when cosmic rays strike atoms in the upper atmosphere. Around 10,000 muons rain down on each square metre of Earth’s surface every minute. Sensitive muon detectors have been developed for use in particle accelerators, but they have also been used in the past decade or so to determine the inner structures of volcanoes and to study the damaged nuclear reactor at Fukushima, Japan.
			<font face = "sans-serif" size = "4"><li>Chamber layout</li></font>
			Whereas other pyramids from this period sit above underground burial chambers, Khufu’s Pyramid contains several large rooms inside the body of the structure itself. These include the King’s chamber, which still holds a stone sarcophagus, the smaller Queen’s chamber and a sloping passageway known as the Grand Gallery.
			These large chambers were discovered in the ninth century ad and explored extensively by Western archaeologists in the nineteenth century. But enthusiasts have wondered ever since whether there might be more hidden chambers inside the pyramid, or even whether the king’s real burial chamber is yet to be found.
			“There are so many theories — nice ones but also crazy ones,” says Mehdi Tayoubi, president of the Heritage Innovation Preservation institute in Paris. So, he co-founded an international collaboration called Scan Pyramids to find out; the project was supervised by the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities. The group is “agnostic” about particular theories, he says, but is using non-invasive technologies to search for hidden chambers.

		Sphinx

			Known in Arabic as Abu Al Hol (Father of Terror), this sculpture of a man with the haunches of a lion was dubbed the Sphinx by the ancient Greeks because it resembled their mythical winged monster who set riddles and killed anyone unable to answer them. A geological survey has shown that it was most likely carved from the bedrock at the bottom of the causeway during Khafre’s reign, so it probably portrays his features.
			As is clear from the accounts of early Arab travellers, the nose was hammered off sometime between the 11th and 15th centuries, although some still like to blame Napoleon for the deed. Part of the fallen beard was carted off by 19th-century adventurers and is now on display in the British Museum in London. These days the Sphinx has potentially greater problems: pollution and rising groundwater are causing internal fractures, and it is under a constant state of repair.
			Legends and superstitions about the Sphinx abound, and the mystery surrounding its long-forgotten purpose is almost as intriguing as its appearance. On seeing it for the first time, many visitors agree with English playwright Alan Bennett, who noted in his diary that seeing the Sphinx is like meeting a TV personality in the flesh: he’s smaller than one had imagined.
			It is impossible to identify what name the creators called their statue, as the Great Sphinx does not appear in any known inscription of the Old Kingdom and there are no inscriptions anywhere describing its construction or its original purpose. In the New Kingdom, the Sphinx was revered as the solar deity Hor-em-akhet (English: Horus of the Horizon; Coptic: ϩⲁⲣⲙⲁϣⲓ; Hellenized: Harmachis), and the pharaoh Thutmose IV specifically referred to it as such in his Dream Stele.
			The Great Sphinx was made by sculpting a limestone mound on the Giza Plateau. It is 57 meters long and almost 20 meters high, built in a single block of natural rock, measuring more than five meters in the face. The head could represent the Pharaoh Khafra, a fact that is not yet certain, because it is possible that it was built by a minor pharaoh, prior to Khafra, having the body in the shape of a Lion. In ancient times it was painted in bright colors: red on the body and face, and the nemes that covered the head with yellow and blue stripes.

			Though there have been conflicting evidence and viewpoints over the years, the view held by modern Egyptology at large remains that the Great Sphinx was built in approximately 2500 BC for the pharaoh Khafre, the builder of the Second Pyramid at Giza. A diorite statue of Khafre, which was discovered buried upside down along with other debris in the Valley Temple, is claimed as support for the Khafre theory.
			The Dream Stele, erected much later by the pharaoh Thutmose IV (1401–1391 or 1397–1388 BC), associates the Sphinx with Khafre. When the stele was discovered, its lines of text were already damaged and incomplete, and only referred to Khaf, not Khafre. An extract was translated.

			 It was built by the pharaoh Khafre, the builder of the Second Pyramid at Giza. 
			Selim Hassan, writing in 1949 on recent excavations of the Sphinx enclosure, summed up the problem:
			Taking all things into consideration, it seems that we must give the credit of erecting this, the world's most wonderful statue, to Khafre, but always with this reservation: that there is not one single contemporary inscription which connects the Sphinx with Khafre; so, sound as it may appear, we must treat the evidence as circumstantial, until such time as a lucky turn of the spade of the excavator will reveal to the world a definite reference to the erection of the Sphinx.
			The Sphinx Temple was built using blocks cut from the Sphinx enclosure, while those of the Valley Temple were quarried from the plateau, some of the largest weighing upwards of 100 tons.

			 Legends have passed over hundreds of years regarding the simple omission in this photograph of the Sphinx and the Pyramid of Khafre, part of the Giza Pyramid (or Great Pyramid) complex in Egypt. Where is the Sphinx’s nose? Many of us have heard the tale that a cannonball fired by Napoleon’s soldiers hit the nose and caused it to break off. Sketches of the Sphinx by the Dane Frederic Louis Norden were created in 1737 and published in 1755, well before the era of Napoleon. However, these drawings illustrate the Sphinx without a nose and clearly contradicts the legend. So what really happened?
			 The Egyptian Arab historian al-Maqrīzī wrote in the 15th century that the nose was actually destroyed by a Sufi Muslim named Muhammad Sa'im al-Dahr. In 1378 CE, Egyptian peasants made offerings to the Great Sphinx in the hope of controlling the flood cycle, which would result in a successful harvest. Outraged by this blatant show of devotion, Sa'im al-Dahr destroyed the nose and was later executed for vandalism. Whether this is absolute fact is still debatable.  
			 Prominent historian and author Bassam el-Shamaa’ mentioned in his book “Hokam Misr El-Qadema” (Ancient Egypt’s Rulers) published in 2009, that Bonaparte is innocent, and his supposed battle was at Imbaba, far away from the Pyramids and the Sphinx.
			 El-Shamaa’ also highlighted that Louis Norden’s painting dates back to 1737 and was published and exhibited in 1744, before the French military campaign in Egypt.
			 He also explained that the real reason for the nose breaking is erosion features, as the rock that Sphinx was carved of is somehow a new geological stone so it could be easily affected by natural erosion such as wind, rain and other natural disasters such as earthquakes.

			Egypt has a huge number of museums and due to the long diverse history of the land of the Nile, Egypt enjoys a huge collection of items and exhibits gathered from different periods of time. The Egyptian government, during the last century, managed to found many interesting museums to house these wonderful items that attracted the attention of tourists from all over the world.
			The Museum of Islamic Ceramics in Cairo's Zamalek neighborhood mainly consists of six sections displaying exhibitions from six styles that were spread in Egypt during different periods of the Islamic history. Each of these sections has its own character and magic the fact which makes a visit to the museum quite interesting for any visitor who is fond of the art of ceramics in particular and Egyptian history in general.
			Arabs and Muslims have always been distinguished in the field of traditional pottery production. Since the early days of Islam, pand even before the appearance of Islam in the Arabian Peninsula, Arabs have used pottery for the production of many items for many diverse uses.
			The idea behind establishing a museum to exhibit Islamic ceramics as a component of the Gezira Arts Center in Zamalek was actually due to a number of factors and reasons. Egypt has one of the most ancient civilizations in the world and the art of ceramics have always been associated with different periods of the Egyptian history. Therefore, there had to be a place to host all this rich large collection of ceramics from Egypt and other neighboring countries.
			The museum occupies the first two floors of Amir Amr Ibrahim Palace in Zamalek, a small neighborhood near downtown Cairo. Constructed in the 1940s, the palace is distinguished with its marvelous architectural and decorative styles which is a wonderful mixture between the European classical styles with the Moroccan, Andalusian, and Turkish influences, a type of art which was quite popular during the ruling period of the family of Mohamed Ali.
			The palace consists mainly of large wide halls and galleries all surrounding the main lobby with the attractive fountain coated with colored marble in the middle and the grand dome above. Featured with its wonderful tinted glass windows, the palace of Prince Amr Ibrahim is a magnificent contemporary monument. The Amir Amr Ibrahim Palace also features wonderfully crafted and ornamented walls and ceilings with many different decorations, calligraphy, and lovely styles of Arabian style decorations.
			It has a Fatimid section, an Ottoman section, an Egyptian section and a Prince section.

		Ceramics are a central, if often neglected, art form of the Middle East and North Africa. Because of its ancient civilizations, this area has a long history of ceramic production. In the Islamic period, conquests and trade within the region and beyond resulted in technological innovations such as metallic glazing, a wide color palette, and the imitation and adaptation of Chinese production techniques long before these innovations reached the West. Despite the frailty of the medium, examples of these important, early ceramics often survived unscathed and are found in museums the world over. The biggest collections, however, are still in the Middle East and North Africa.
		When the Ministry of Culture decided to add to its series of specialised museums one for Islamic ceramics, it chose the palace of Prince Ibrahim in Zamalek, built in 1343 H. (1924 A.D.). 
		Undoubtedly, this choice was inspired by the palace's impressive Islamic architecture and decoration, as well as its location in a quiet and fashionable district in the heart of the city.
 		This splendid palace, a masterpiece in its own right, provides an ideal setting for the precious works of Muslim ceramists throughout Islamic history. The Museum of Islamic Ceramics, inaugurated in late 1998, is an integral part of the renovated and refurbished Gezira Art Centre affiliated to the National Centre for Arts, Ministry of Culture.
