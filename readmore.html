<h1>Bibliotheca Alexandrina</h1>
<p>
	The new Library of Alexandria, the new Bibliotheca Alexandrina (BA), is dedicated to recapturing the spirit of openness and scholarship of the original Bibliotheca Alexandrina. It is much more than a library. It comprises the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The Main Library (which can hold up to millions of books) and its affiliated libraries: the Francophone Library, the Depository Library, and the Maps Library
</li>
<li>Six specialized libraries:
<ol>

<li>The Arts and Multimedia Library</li>	
<li>The Taha Hussein Library for the visually-impaired</li>
<li>The Children’s Library</li>
<li>The Young People’s Library</li>
<li>The Exchange and Archive Section</li>
<li>The Rare Books and Special Collections Library</li>
</ol>
</li>

	<li>A copy of the Internet Archive</li>
<li>Four museums:
<ol>
	<li>The Antiquities Museum</li>
	<li>The Manuscripts Museum</li>
	<li>The Sadat Museum</li>
	<li>The History of Science Museum</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The Planetarium Science Center (PSC)</li>

</div>
<li>The ALEXploratorium: an exploratorium for introducing children to science</li>

<li>The Culturama: a cultural panorama projected over nine screens. It is the first ever patented nine-projector interactive system. It has won many awards. The Culturama, developed by CULTNAT, allows the presentation of a wealth of data layers; presenters can click on an item and go to a whole new level of detail. It is a remarkably informative and attractive multimedia presentation of Egypt’s heritage spanning over 5,000 years of history with highlights and examples of Ancient Egyptian and Coptic/Muslim heritage.
</li>

<li>VISTA (The Virtual Immersive Science and Technology Applications system): an interactive virtual reality environment that allows researchers to transform two-dimensional data sets into 3D simulations and step inside them. A practical tool of visualization during research, VISTA helps researchers to simulate the behavior of natural or human-engineered systems instead of merely observing a system or building a physical model.</li>

<li>Twelve academic research centers:

<h1>Building Date</h1>
<p>Commissioned in 1989 as a contemporary resurrection of the fabled Library at Alexandria once venerated throughout the ancient world, the present building was intended to serve as a city's connection to history and heritage.</p>
<h1>Who Built it</h1>
<p>The ancient Library of Alexandria was not the only library in the ancient world, but it was the most famous of them despite the existence of other libraries that preceded it. Historians disagreed about the true founder of the library. Ptolemy the First was a cultured and literary lover, so he was credited with establishing the Scientific Council and the Royal Library.</p>
